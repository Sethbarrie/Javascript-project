This is a small tower climb game with easy level creation on the back end for quick expansion. The player interacts and manuvers around the environment to climb the tower to make it to the top. The player can interact with enemies by hitting them with his sword to eventually kill them, or get hit by the enemies scattered through the map and eventually die. 

The map is loaded from a game file, and only loads one map and not all maps, to be more efficient.
